                <p> <strong>The place I'm working at right now:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Worked with a team on a web application that helps control a budget of 
                    a mid-sized organization. The app increased employee accountability and 
                    provided a convinient tool for keeping track of budget operations.
                    Technologies used: 
                    <ul>
                        <li> javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS for frontend;</li>
                        <li> Transact-SQL for getting data from a MS Server database.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The place I worked at before:</strong>
                    <br>
                    While studying for my master's degree worked on a project for 
                    internal document flow mostly used by professors and university 
                    employees. PHP was used along with MySQL for storing data and 
                    javascript/HTML/CSS for frontend.

                <p>Spent 5 months in the USA as a Work and Travel student that helped me improve
