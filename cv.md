Experience
----------

**The place I'm working at right now:**

Worked with a team on a web application that helps control a budget of 
a mid-sized organization. The app increased employee accountability and 
provided a convenient tool for keeping track of budget operations.
Technologies used: 
* javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS for frontend;
* Transact-SQL for retrieving data from a MS Server database.

**The place I worked at before:**

While studying for my master's degree worked on a project for 
internal document flow mostly used by professors and university 
employees. PHP was used along with MySQL for storing data and 
javascript/HTML/CSS for frontend.

Programming Languages
----------

**javascript:** The language I'm most comfortable with over two years 
    of experience. Used such tools as jQuery, Bootstrap, AmChart. Recently 
    started learning other frameworks such as React.js and Node.js.

**PHP:** Was used as a primary language when I was developing a web-application
    while working at the university. I know the basics of the language though haven't 
    had a chance to use it as of late.

Basic knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **git**


Code Example
----------

Write a function that takes an array and counts the number of each unique element present.  
count(['james', 'james', 'john'])  #=>  { 'james': 2, 'john': 1}
```
function count(array){
  const unique = new Set(array);
  
  let obj = {};
  unique.forEach( (item) => obj[item] = array.filter(x => x === item).length );
  return obj;
}
```
